# 🗃️ Organiser App

This is a real-world project I’m building alongside my developer roadmap. It’s designed to showcase everything I learn in context — from setting up a Spring Boot backend to scaling with microservices.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Instead of just learning theory, I’m applying it in a project that solves a common problem: digital organisation.

The project includes:

- ✅ To-do Lists with status tracking
- 🗓️ Calendar & Reminders
- 📓 Notes & Documentation
- 👥 Team/Friend Collaboration
- 💬 Chat & Notifications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (initially)

- **Backend**: Java + Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: TBD (eventually React/TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: Spring Security
- **Docs**: Docusaurus + Markdown
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: JUnit + Mockito

## 🚧 Project Workflow

This project will be built **incrementally** as we move through the roadmap.

- Each roadmap topic has a linked real-world implementation.
- All changes are tracked and documented.
- Vertical slicing will be used to release working features early.
- Horizontal slicing may be used to showcase deep dives on tech/tools.
