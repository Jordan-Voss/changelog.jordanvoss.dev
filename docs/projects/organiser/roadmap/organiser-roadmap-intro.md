# 👋 Welcome to the OrganisePro Implementation Roadmap

This section mirrors my main developer roadmap and demonstrates how each core concept is implemented within the OrganizePro application.

Think of this as the **"applied" roadmap** where theory becomes reality. If the main roadmap teaches *what*, this one teaches *how*.

## 🌐 Structure

Each roadmap section:
- Links to related concepts from [main roadmap](/roadmap)
- Breaks down the actual code and logic used in our Organiser Project
- Explains decisions made and alternative approaches

Start with:
- [☕ Java Foundations](/projects/organiser/roadmap/java)
- [🌱 Spring Boot Setup](/projects/organiser/roadmap/spring)
- [📦 Microservices Design](/projects/organiser/roadmap/microservices)
