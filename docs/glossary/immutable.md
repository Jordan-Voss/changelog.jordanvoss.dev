# Immutable

**Definition:**  
An object whose state cannot be changed after it is created.

---

## Detailed Explanation
- Any modification creates a new object rather than altering the original.
- Immutable objects are thread-safe and predictable.
- Common examples: strings in many languages, numeric wrappers.

---

## Example

// Immutable string example
// string s1 = "Hello";
// string s2 = s1;
// s2 = "World"; // s1 remains "Hello"
