# Variable

**Definition:**  
A named storage location in memory for data, which has a type.

## Detailed Explanation
- A variable represents a named reference to a value in memory.
- It allows programs to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
- Variables must usually be declared before use, with their type defining what values they can hold.
- Common pitfalls include using uninitialized variables or assuming they hold data after scope ends.
