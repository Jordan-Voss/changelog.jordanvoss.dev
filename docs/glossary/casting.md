# Casting

**Definition:**  
Manually converting a value from one data type to another.

---

## Detailed Explanation
- Explicitly tells the compiler to treat a value as a different type.
- Can be safe (widening) or unsafe (narrowing with possible data loss).
- Often required when working with mixed types.

---

## Example

// Casting double to int
// double pi = 3.14;
// int whole = (int) pi;
