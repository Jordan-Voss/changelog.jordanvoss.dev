# Java Variable Naming
Naming variables correctly is important for writing **readable** and **maintainable** code. Variable names can be enforced by the Java compiler, to make sure they follow the language's rules (no spaces, valid characters etc.), but **naming conventions** are also used as a guide for developers to structure names so that it remains clear and readable for everyone involved

## On this page you‚Äôll learn:
- The standard Java naming conventions
- The difference between compiler-enforced rules and agreed-upon style conventions  
- Examples of good vs. bad variable names and why conventions matter

## Variable Naming Rules (Compiler-Enforced)

In Java, every <GlossaryTooltip term="variable" definition="A named storage location in memory for data, which has a type." link="/glossary/variable" bold="true"/> must follow certain **rules**.

### What variable names should be
- Made up of **letters, digits, underscores (`_`)**, or **dollar signs (`$`)**  
- Begin with a **letter**, underscore, or dollar sign (never a digit)  
- Written consistently ‚Äî remember, Java is **case-sensitive** (`age` and `Age` are different)

### What variable names cannot be
- Cannot start with a digit (`2items` is invalid)  
- Cannot use spaces or special characters (`total-cost`, `user@name`)  
- Cannot be a reserved <GlossaryTooltip term="keyword" definition="Words reserved by the Java language with special meaning, like class, if, static." link="/glossary/keyword" bold="true" /> (`class`, `if`, `static`).  
See the [keyword glossary entry](/glossary/keyword) for the full list.

### Examples
Valid:  
```java
int count;
double _value;
float $price;
```
Invalid:
```java
int 2count;
double class;
float total-cost;
```

### Variable Naming Conventions (Style Guidelines)

Java has widely accepted naming conventions, these are not enforced by the compiler but are expected in professional code.
