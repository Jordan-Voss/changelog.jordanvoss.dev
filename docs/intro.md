# 👋 Welcome to My Dev Journey

Hi, I’m Jordan, a 27 year old software developer working primarily with **Java** and **Spring Boot**. I've been building systems professionally for several years, and in that time, I've developed a deep appreciation for **clean code**, **scalable architecture**, and c**ontinual self-improvement**.


This site is my **public changelog**: a place where I document my learning journey as I aim to grow as a developer. I believe in learning out loud, not just for my own benefit, but to teach others, reinforce what I already know, and keep myself accountable.

Whether you're a **junior dev** trying to find your way, or a **seasoned engineer** looking to brush up on core concepts, I hope you'll find something here that helps you.

## 🧭 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ **A structured roadmap** – covering fundamentals to advanced backend concepts  
- ✍️ **Blog posts** – lessons learned, dev reflections, and code breakdowns  
- 🧰 **Resources** – tools, templates, shortcuts, and productivity hacks  
- 💡 **Reflections** – what worked, what didn’t, and how I adapted 
- 🏗️ **A real-world project** – built alongside the roadmap to reinforce every topic

## 🧠 Why I Built This

> “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” – Albert Einstein

I’ve found that **writing**, **teaching**, and **building projects** are the most effective ways to retain knowledge. This site is how I do that — and hopefully, it helps others too.

I’ll be sharing:

- Java deep dives — from syntax to JVM internals  
- Spring Boot design patterns & real-world practices
- Microservices architecture & DevOps workflows  
- Testing, debugging, performance tuning  
- Developer mindset, decision-making, and career growth

While my current focus is on **backend development** through **Java** and **Spring Boot**, I may expand this site in the future to include other tools, technologies, and even front-end or cloud-related topics as my journey continues.

## 🚀 Get Started

👉 Explore the [Interactive Roadmap](/roadmap)

Or dive straight into a topic:

- [Java 17 Deep Dive](/roadmap/java)
- [Spring Boot Internals](/roadmap/spring)
- [Microservices Architecture](/roadmap/microservices)

---

## 🏗️ A Real Project Along the Way

This isn’t just theory — I’m applying everything I learn by building a real-world project alongside the roadmap: the [Organiser App](/projects/organiser).

It’s a Spring Boot–based application that includes features like task tracking, calendar integration, notes, and even team collaboration. Each topic in the roadmap has a corresponding implementation in the app, so you can see how theory translates into real code.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope this journey adds value to yours too!
